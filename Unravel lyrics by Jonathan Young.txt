Oh, can you tell me... can you tell me
The way the story ends...
A monster in my heart, a ghost inside my chest
I'm broken down, the world around us
Surround my suffering
You smile and laugh at me, but you don't see a thing
Damaged and broken as I'm,
I'm trying not to breathe,
Unraveled i'm
Not unraveled by the truth i finally see (freeze)
I'm breakable, unbreakable, I'm shakeable, unshakeable
Unraveling since i found you
And now I'm turning to dust in a world that's twisted
Don't come searching when i go missing
Close your eyes or just try to look away (don't want to hurt you)
We live in the world someone else imagined
The ghost of what's left of me all but vanished
Remember my heart... how bright I used to shine
